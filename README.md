## Problem

* Incomplete feedback loop for suspicious matter reporting - entites get no confirmation of their reported suspicions
* Incomplete data - entities are isolated and Austrac only gets some data
* Binary thresholds - not intelligent
* Can't identify

## Solution

* Financial institutions to report all transactions and associated profiles to Austrac
* Austrac would use an AI to identify suspicious transactions; and from there identify suspicious entities or entities that are suspected to be part of a network (organised crime)

## Feasibility

* Cost vs benefit for reporting entities
  * No more SMRs
  * Lower cost

## Tech
